	<p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas> element, together with JavaScript.</p>

<h1 id="headers">Headers</h1>
	<p>A HTML heading or HTML h tag can be defined as a title or a subtitle which you want to display on the webpage. When you place the text within the heading tags, it is displayed on the browser in the bold format and size of the text depends on the number of heading.
There are six different HTML headings which are defined with the h1 to h6 tags, from highest level h1 (main heading) to the least level h6 (least important heading.
h1 is the largest heading tag and h6 is the smallest one. So h1 is used for most important heading and h6 is used for least important.</p>
<h2>Header 2</h2>
<h3>Header 3</h3>
<h4>Header 4</h4>
<h5>Header 5</h5>
<h6>Header 6</h6>
<p>Here's a quick guide on header tags and what they're used for:

H1 — The title of a post. They're usually keyword-centric, focused around the "big idea" of a page or post, and crafted to grab a reader's attention.
H2 — These are subheaders that classify the main points of your paragraphs and separate sections. Consider using semantic keywords related to the "big idea" in your H1 while also helping the reader easily find the sections they want to read.
H3 — These are subsections that clarify the points made in the H2 further. Alternatively, they can be used in formatting lists or bullet points.
H4 —These are subsections that clarify the points made in the H3 further. Alternatively, they can be used in formatting lists or bullet points.
The "H" in H1, H2, etc. officially stands for "heading element," though the SEO community also commonly calls these tags "header tags."

As you can guess from the guide above, the numeral indicates the <strong>hierarchal relationship</strong> between each one (with H1 being the most important, H2 being less important, and so on).</p>
<p>The heading tag is of central importance for search engines. Search engines use heading tags to identify keywords that stand out from the remaining content by their formatting. 
The importance of the heading tag is expressed by “n” <mark>(H1 very important, and H6 less important)</mark>. There are some theories in on-page optimization specifying that the H2 headings should have particular emphasis, and that they should include significant keywords because the actual text content of a website is structured with these headings. At the same time, it is important that signals get sent to search engines through headings. So it should be well-balanced, taking into account user needs and also <del>complying</del> with the requirements of search engine optimization</p>

	<p>HTML table tag is used to display data in tabular form (row * column). There can be many columns in a row.
We can create a table to display data in tabular form, using table element, with the help of tr , td, and th elements.
In Each table, table row is defined by tr tag, table header is defined by th, and table data is defined by td tags.
HTML tables are used to manage the layout of the page e.g. header section, navigation bar, body content, footer section etc. But it is recommended to use div tag over table to manage the layout of the page .
Each table may have an associated caption (see the CAPTION element) that provides a short description of the table's purpose. A longer description may also be provided (via the summary attribute) for the benefit of people using speech or Braille-based user agents.



Authors may also group columns to provide additional structural information that may be exploited by user agents. Furthermore, authors may declare column properties at the start of a table definition (via the COLGROUP and COL elements) in a way that enables user agents to render the table incrementally rather than having to wait for all the table data to arrive before rendering.


Tables should not be used purely as a means to layout document content as this may present problems when rendering to non-visual media. Additionally, when used with graphics, these tables may force users to scroll horizontally to view a table designed on a system with a larger display. To minimize these problems, authors should use style sheets to control layout rather than tables.

<h1 id="list">Types of lists</h1>
<p>n HTML unordered list, the list items have no specific order or sequence. An unordered list is also called a Bulleted list, as the items are marked with bullets. It begins with the ul> tag and and closes with a ul> tag. The list items begin with the li> tag and end with li> tag.</p>

<h1 id="blockquotes">Blockquotes</h1>

<p>The blockquote element is used to indicate the quotation of a large section of text from another source. Using the default HTML styling of most web browsers, it will indent the right and left margins both on the display and in printed form, but this may be overridden by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

The non-semantic use of the blockquote element purely to indent text has been deprecated by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) since HTML 4.[2] The preferred approach is the use of CSS.
<br>
Related HTML elements include the q> and cite> tags for shorter, probably in-line, quotations and for citations respectively. An HTML attribute specific to the blockquote> and q> tags is cite= where the provenance of the material quoted may be given. If the quotation is in a language other than that of the main document, lang= and maybe dir= attributes may be relevant to specify the language of the quoted text and perhaps its direction, left-to-right or right-to-left. class= may be used for semantic or styling purposes.
